# PacMen Exercise

This project was part of the MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN Course. It allows the user to add PacMan to a page and to start their movement. It detects when a PacMan hits the edge of the page and rotates the direction of the PacMan. The focus of this project was on working with arrays, passing arguments to functions and using JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
